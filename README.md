## Welcome to Funversant Games, new Coders

Welcome to Funversant Games, thanks for joining out coding team. You all will be working on a new Endless Runner we're developing. Our senior dev on the project got a prototype done, but he's gone off on a six month sabbatical to study underwater basket weaving with the Scuba Monks in Key West.

So let's get you all set up with your programming environment and get his prototype cloned into your working directories.

## Possible Improvements

Adjust jump speed (gravity, power)

Randomize height of the platforms

Animate the runner

Keep score based on platforms passed

Add coins and score based on coins collected

Add a pause and "hit any key" for replay

Make it harder by making it faster
